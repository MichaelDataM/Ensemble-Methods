estimator: the base estimator from which the boosted ensemble is build
n_estimators : the maximum number of estimators at which boosting is terminated
learning_rate: weight applied to each classifier at each iteration.A higher learning rate increase the contribution of each classifier. There is a trade-off between learning rate and n_estimators
random_state: controls the random seed given at each boosting iteration. It is only used when the estimator exposes a random state.
